    "This project identifies and paints circles given in RGB images. Specifically, each input image contains a rectangle, a triangle and a circle. The image is fed into a neural netork, whose outputs are the center and radius of the circle within the image. The domain considered is \"[0,1]x[0,1] \"box\". PyTorch is the platform used. The goal is to paint the circle.\n",

    "  Three directories named \"train\", \"validation\", and \"test\" each containing the following:\n",

    "### ** What you need to do **\n",
    "You have 5 (and a half...) things to do:\n",
    " 1. Create a CircleNet class, which is your network model. This is a key component. The output of your model should be 3 numbers that represent the the center and radius of the circle in the input image fed into your network. You should keep in mind the number of parameters in your model. If there are too many, it may overfit (and take longer to run). If there are too few, you it may not be able to learn the task needed. A typical structure would have convolutional layers first and fully connected at the end, thus reducing number of parameteres. Consider which activation function you want to use, and whether or not you wish to use batch normalization or dropout. Pooling layers are also possible. Be creative.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Create a loss function. This is another key component as it defines what it means for two circles (the true circle and its estimation) to be similar or not. Namely, two circles (represented by two centers and two radii: ground truth (\"labels\") and network outputs (\"outputs\")), whose images look similar should have a smaller loss than two circles whose images look less simialr. Think about how you would quantify \"closeness\"/\"similarity\" of circles.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Choose an optimizer. Look here for some ideas: https://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. (This is the \"half\" thing to do). For your conveinece you may want to use the function calc_ops() that is given to you to calculate an estimate of the number of operations that your network does per feed forward. To do this, you need to enter your own network structure. An example of an arbitrary network is privided to you.\n",
    " \n",
    " 5. Create a validate_model function that assesses (tests) the performance of a model. It returns the average loss per image for a given loader. It can be run on any set of data (train, validation, or test). You may want to run this function on validation set (loader) from within the train function (see below) train after each epoch so as to see how loss behaves on validation during the training process.\n",
    " \n",
    " 6. Create a train_model function that trains model. This function updates the following parameteres: model, train_losses, and validation_losses. Model is updated simply by the training processes when optimzer.step() is called. The other two parameteres are lists that hold the average loss per image for the corresponding data (train or validation). After every epoch (i.e., iteration that goes over the entire train data), you should save to these lists the average loss per image for the corresponding data loader. These lists are useful in that you can plot them (functionality given to you) and observe how model behaves. Observe: this fucnton returs nothing, however, it updates parameteres by reference. Specifically, model is updated (trained), and so are train and validation losses values.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Note:** You are given three sets of data: trian, validation, and test. It is recommended that test not be touched until the very end, and validation be used to get a sense of your network's performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ** Running on a GPU: **\n",
    "It is not necessary to use a GPU for this project. However, if you choose to do so, you will gain a major speedup to your training, which will save you much time. The code given to you identifies the hardware used and will  automatically run on either a GPU or CPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ** Useful links: **\n",
    "1. PyTorch master tutorial - VERY useful: https://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html\n",
    "2. PyTorch optimizers: https://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html\n",
    "3. A list of possible reasons why things go wrong: https://blog.slavv.com/37-reasons-why-your-neural-network-is-not-working-4020854bd607#74de\n",
    "\n",
    "### ** Final tips: **\n",
    "Use the Internet! Things will not work first time. You will get strange error messages. Google them up. The web is  great resource for tackling problems ranging from python error messages, to things not doing what you'd like them to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ** Submission Instructions**\n",
    "The project is to be submittd in teams as in the homework. You need to submit the following three files:\n",
    "1. model.dat                            - This is your saved model \n",
    "2. paint_that_circle.ipynb              - This is this notebook containing all of your work\n",
    "3. model.py                             - A file containing your CircleNet class only. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you submit, run \"check_before_submission.ipynb\" to make sure your model could be properly tested. See instructions for running this notebook inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your names appear at the top of this notebook in the appropriate place.\n",
